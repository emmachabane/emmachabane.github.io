        <p>My name is Emma and I am a first-year Masters student at MIT studying computer science and cognitive science. My main 
          academic interest is language, specifcally the way we humans create and process it, but also how to improve intelligent machines so that 
          they can reach the same levels of language understanding and creation as us! I am a graduate researcher in MIT CSAIL's InfoLab, currently working on 
          quantifying human perception and evaluation of writing quality using NLP and sociolinguistics. I also just graduated from MIT in June
          2023 with a bachelor's degree in computation and cognition, and a minor in Spanish! <br> <br> When I am not studying for classes or working on my research, 
          you can find me playing board games with friends (latest obssession: Catan), playing games on my switch (currently : Pikmin 4), watching new shows (currently: One Piece), 
          or finding new recipes to make! Send me a message to talk about the interesection of art and science, anime, conlangs (and language in general), and cool video 
          games!<br> <br> I am currently looking for summer 2024 internships. If you are hiring for positions related to NLP, data science, ML, HCI, or product engineering,
          send me an email at echabane@mit.edu !</p>
