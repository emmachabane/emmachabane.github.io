description: I am a graduate researcher at MIT CSAIL studying human perception and assessment of writing quality by leveraging data from a short story competition (user submitted written prose and their associated rankings). Currently, there exists no objective linguistic metrics that capture what it means for something to be well written, and even state of the art NLP models lack quality prediction capabilities. However, humans seem to have an innate understanding of what writing quality signifies. We aim to quantify what it means for something to be "well written" by analyzing the following\: <br /> <br />1. How humans score given short stories (and how that changes with amount of data given,...) <br /> <br /> 2. What features of prose affect scores the most (based on various psycholinguistic features) <br /> <br /> 3. How NLP classification models assess whether written prose would score well or poorly in a short story competition
