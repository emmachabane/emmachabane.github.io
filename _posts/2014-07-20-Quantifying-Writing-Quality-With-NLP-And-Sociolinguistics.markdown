description: I am a graduate researcher at MIT CSAIL studying human perception and assessment of writing quality by leveraging data from a short story competition (user submitted written prose and their associated rankings). Currently, there exists no objective linguistic metrics that capture what it means for something to be well written, and even state of the art NLP models lack quality prediction capabilities. However, humans seem to have an innate understanding of what writing quality signifies. We aim to quantify what it means for something to be "well written" by analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data from the competition, as well as through the development of state of the art NLP models. Indeed, we can learn much by analyzing both how humans score various short stories and comparing it to how NLP classification models perform on such task. Lastly, studying how a plethora of psycholinguistic features and differences affect scoring might give us interesting insights as to how language affects writing perception.
