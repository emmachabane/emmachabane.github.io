description: In late hgih school, I spent some time studying the dichotomy between mathematics and art. Indeed, I had attended a university conference on the beauty of mathematics that I particularly enjoyed, the subject seeming both intriguing and captivating, which prompted my research. The "math-art" hybrid couple always seemed to me to be fabulously lively, and art and mathematics are not often thought of together.  Art is often seen as something "beautiful", from an exclusively aesthetic angle. We forget too often its regular and codified dimension. It is a subject that, arguably, is very close to mathematics, a discipline meant to demonstrate facts meaningfully and logically. Similarly, mathematics can also be seen as beautiful. As a result of these thoughts, I started research linking these two subjects, which led to my project. I worked with Stanford professor and artist John Edmark to gain insight on the subject. In the end, I wrote a thirty pages dissertation presenting my research and its outcome. Moreover, I built a 3D printed sculpture using the SketchUp software: Statera , the balance.
