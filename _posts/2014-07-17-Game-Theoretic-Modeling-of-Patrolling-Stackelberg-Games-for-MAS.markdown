description: For my Cognitive Robotics final project, I worked on creating simulations of multi-agent systems whose aim was to patrol a house. We use game theory, and specifically Stackerlberg games to frame our project, and solved for the optimal policies using a Decomposed Optimized Bayesian Stackelberg Solver. With Bayesian Stackelberg games we can frame a patrolling scenario as a solvable problem. Normally, those who are patrolling are at a direct disadvantage compared to those who are trying to attack, since they have to make their move first and they can be observed. However, this exact scenario can be framed as a Stackelberg game where the leader is the security doing patrol and the follower is an attacker. While accounting for possible attacker types, the optimal policy for the leader is solved for using a Decomposed Optimized Bayesian Stackelberg Solver. For games where number of valuables, length of patrol, or number of attacker types remains under 5, the game is solved on average under .10 seconds.  [here](/img/gcreport.pdf)
