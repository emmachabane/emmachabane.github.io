description: Perception is malleable. By using different speeds, motions, and light frequencies, my piece Light Echo illustrates the illusory nature of object perception. Objects exist within a rich and complex environment, and they may look different based on the perceptual parameters applied to the object. In this piece, the invisible relationship between motion and light is brought to the realm of the physical by creating shape deformations, what I called the “light echoes” of the rotating cube, where the eponymous name of the piece comes from. <br /> The goal of my perceptual experience is to observe the cube projection, and watch how light helps construct and deconstruct the objects that we perceive. On the other side of the projection, a wireframe cube is attached to a rotating motor turning at around ~50 rpm. Moreover, a red laser line created from a laser pointer and cylindrical optic lens is reflected by a mirror octagonal prism. This laser line reflection sweeps the cube as it is itself turning onto itself. The result? Projections of deformed and contorted shapes. Can viewers figure out what the original shape was?
