description: I investigated the neural basis of linguistic surprisal by analyzing relationship between cognitive activity and surprisal scores, given 55h+ of intracranial recordings and annotated treebank. The word probabilities in our surprisal models were computed three-way: an LSTM model, an n-gram model, and a GPT-2 model.
