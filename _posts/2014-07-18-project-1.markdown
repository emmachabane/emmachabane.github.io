description: I investigated the neural basis of surprisal by analyzing relationship between cognitive activity and surprisal scores, given 55h+ of intracranial recordings and annotated treebank. In this project, we computed word probabilities for our surprisal scores using LSTM, n-gram, and GPT-2 models.
