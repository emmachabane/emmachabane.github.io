description: Linguistic communication is no easy task, and is very often subject to noise : speakers can make errors or introduce ambiguity, and our environment can introduce 
other sounds which might make it difficult to comprehend one another. Nonetheless, people can generally understand each other easily, therefore suggesting that the way 
humans process and understand language accounts for the omnipresent noise in our lives. As such, one can make inferences about the speaker’s intended meaning when utterances have
been subjected to potential noise. Given prior information and a noise model, that is, what they know about the world, people can make inferences to understand what they perceive.
According to this model, the noisy channel framework, the probability of the perceived sentence being interpreted as the intended sentence is proportional to the prior probability 
that the intended sentence given a person’s world knowledge as well as the probability that the intended sentence could have been mistakenly transformed to the perceived sentence
during linguistic communication. <br> <br> Overall, the noise model has been studied extensively in English, and recent studies have started looking into the application and 
evaluation of the model in a few other languages. <br> <br> My project focuses on evaluating the noisy channel framework in a new language, French, and replicates the results 
obtained from a previous study done on Spanish.
