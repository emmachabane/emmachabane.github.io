description: I investigated the neural basis of surprisal by analyzing relationship between cognitive activity and surprisal scores, given 55h+ of intracranial recordings and annotated treebank. In this project, we computed word probabilities for our surprisal scores using LSTM, n-gram, and GPT-2 models. Above are raster plots and graphs of the neural voltage activity in the superior temporal gyrus region of the brain for the movie Cars 2. Surprisal was computed as the negative log of word probability, using word probabilities from the GPT-2 language model.  <br /> <br /> <p><a href="/img/9.58 final project report-2.pdf">See my full paper here!</a></p>
