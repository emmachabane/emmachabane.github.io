description: Linguistic communication is no easy task, and is very often subject to noise. Speakerscan make errors or introduce ambiguity, and our environment can introduce other  sounds which might make it difficult to comprehend one another.  Nonetheless, people can generally understand each other easily, therefore suggesting that the way humans process and understand language accounts for the omnipresent noise in our lives. The noisy channel framework is a model that explains how humans are able to make inferences about speakers' intended meaning when utterances have been subjected to potential noise. Given prior information and a noise model, that is, what they know about the world, people can indeed infer to understand what they perceive. <br /> <br /> My project endeavored to apply and evaluate the noisy channel framework to the French language, and replicatd recent results where the model was tested on the Spanish language. <br /> <br /> <p><a href="/img/A noisy channel framework for sentence comprehension in Spanish and French.pdf">See my full paper here!</a></p>
